# Actions

Test GH actions behavior

For now it welcomes contributors on new pull requests and provides issue templates.

It does not yet suggests to choose a PR template because:

- There can be one or none main PR template, and it is always chosen if it exists
- Other templates are to be selected with a URL parameter, so it is really hard to use it efficiently

As I already have PR templates in other repositories and it is simple to do (just a MD file), I won't add an example here.
